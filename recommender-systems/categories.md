Collaborative filtering:
* If a user A likes product X, and user B has not liked. You could recommend
  product X to user B provided they are friends/similar users.

* If you recomend music to someone who has already bought music, you are
  recomending a replacement product. However, if they buy a phone you can
  recommend complementary products
